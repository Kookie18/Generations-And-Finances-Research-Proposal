    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>A critical part for working adults is knowing how to handle and manage their financial needs. This is more professionally known as “financial capacity”. Older generations or those ages sixty-five and older, carry a disproportionate amount of wealth in the United States. Along with their uneven possession of wealth, many older people in the US may have dementia or general loss of cognitive ability which can affect their financial capacity. As for the youth, many face pressure and difficulty when making financial decisions as they have not developed complete financial capacity. The younger population have to consider their spending habits and how that affects their future financial self. Older generations appear to possess “too much” wealth and may not have rational thinking or financial capacity to manage it. The youth are just starting to gain financial capacity, but receive much criticism or consequences from financial choices that could impact their future. There is too much pressure put on youth regarding their financial lives and not enough support for the elderly and their possession of wealth.
Some conversations that have been discussed is the socio-economic status of the youth and retirement issues for seniors. A child’s financial and socio-economic status is most likely going to reflect their parents status, which will influence how the child will approach financial decisions. “ ‘reproduction of advantage’ whereby parents’ educational and financial resources… impact young people’s financial skills…” ( Riach et al. 802 ). The parents birthplace and their financial decisions heavily influences on how their children will financially behave as well. As for the elderly, retirement security has failed those who are sixty-five and older. “… policy makers and corporations have not prepared well for the baby boomers’ retirement” ( Marson and Sabatino 8 ). The ones in charge of taking care of the baby boomers’ money and financial lifestyle were unprepared because of how drastic the financial world has changed. 
While these conversations are important, it raises questions and concerns for the youth and the elderly. How can the youth and elderly create a better financial life? Is there a solution to increasing financial capacity? How can the youth and elderly improve their financial capacity and financial lives? What contributes to the differences between the youth and elderly financial lives?. I believe these questions would be very useful as a research paper and as knowledge for myself as well.
