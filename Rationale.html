 <p> How can the youth and elderly improve their financial capacity and financial lives? As time goes on, money will remain as the currency that may put someoneâ€™s life at a disadvantage. Their loss of money could include a factor of issues: bankruptcy, reckless spending, or maybe insufficient wages. Discovering how the generations could improve their financial situations could create a chain effect for future generations and influence their decisions as well. For this question, I believe that both the younger and older generation will demonstrate high control of their financial situations and decisions. External forces will create the negative effects, however, steps taken by both generations can result in an example of control over their situations. 
Financial services are a large part of how the youth and elderly handle money and finances. They can be pressuring and intimidating for those who are financially struggling and are unable to reach out for help. Often times, they exploit and take advantage of young and older people since they are the most vulnerable. If the older and younger generation are made aware of efficient steps to improve their own financial situation, they can defy the odds of exploitation from these services. 
If proven correct, the young and old generations demonstrate their willingness and determination to improving their financial lives even with disadvantages from government entities and businesses. If proven incorrect, financial services will need to change their methods and improve their services in order to help the vulnerable people.
