In “Financial Timescapes: The Temporal Shaping of Young People’s Financial Lives”, their
method of study was to collect data from individuals with different education and occupation backgrounds. They conducted face-to-face interviews with a series of questions that included (but not limited to) finance-related decisions, wages, debt and challenges. The research that I would conduct would be very similar to what these authors did. I would gather data by creating a survey sent to different kinds of people and analyze the responses I acquire.
	In order to test my hypothesis, I would create a survey that asks each participant information about their financial decisions, current wages (if working), and their financial challenges. I would also ask questions about how they would go to improve their financial literacy and decisions in general. After all participants have answered, I would categorize according to generation or age group. Then, I would analyze and find trends that highlight characteristics of each generation. This will create evidence for me, which I can use in the research paper and compare or contrast the information that I’ve gathered. A sample that I would test would be someone between 16-24 with a lower-class background. I would chose this person because it would highlight the struggles as a young person and how their financial decisions carry weight and heavily affect their future. I would exclude those who were born wealthy and became wealthy themselves. Unless they had any other unique trait, these type of people are not going to be useful in my research. 
	I would attempt to present the survey to people with different types of backgrounds, race or ethnicity, and parent or guardian situations. I would include hypothetical financial situations and record their answers. These factors would allow me to discover trends or similar ideas across the participants and create a conclusion. It could be disconfirmed if each participant had unique answers that carried no resemblance to one another. Some factors I would control are wage/income and current financial situation. If my results appear to confirm my hypothesis, I would hope that the participants would actively work on improving their financial decisions and capacity. If my results disconfirm my hypothesis, I would take further action and research about financial institutions or services that likely affect the participants. After the survey is conducted, I would ask the participants if I could have a follow-up interview and discuss their changes (if any) concerning financial capacity and their financial lives. 
	I will send a hypothetical situation along with the survey and the participant can answer in whichever capacity they wish. I will then read through all responses and form connections, find trends among each participant, or discover any outliers. To confirm my hypothesis, most participants would have to create a response that follows the general “rules” or steps to improving their financial situations or discusses struggles – which may follow a characteristic in other participants - in their current financial situation. Results that would disconfirm my hypothesis are participants who are very financially stable and have had no significant struggles with their financial life.
