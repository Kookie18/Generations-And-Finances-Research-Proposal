    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>My research topic is about the financial stability of the generations in
the United States. The generations refers to the different “era” of people, such as: Baby Boomers, Generation X, The Silent Generation, and Generation Z. The general area of study will be focused on the economic trends of inflation, wages and income, through these generations. These types of economic trends would be important to study because it can be used to predict and prepare for the future. It would assist with economic decisions from private companies and the government along with other institutions that affect the public within the generation.
